          Bill Owen took over from Eric Mensforth as Chairman of Governors until 1989.
          He was an active trade unionist and became Lord Mayor in 1980.
          He persuaded the council on a free vote to bar circuses featuring live animal acts from Sheffield's parks.
          He also led campaigns to oppose hare coursing and testing on animals.</div>

          As part of the 2012 Olympics torch relay, three inspirational sporting champions from the University were
          selected to carry the Olympic torch when it
          came through Sheffield in June. Student Stephen Birkby, Hallam Union sports officer Colan Leung and
          head of Sport Services Dan Porter all took turns carrying the torch through the city, cheered on by thousands
          of people.</div>

          Designed by Nigel Coates Architects, the HUBS divided opinion when they opened. The four steel kettles were
